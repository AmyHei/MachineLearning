Now that we've seen the concepts behind transfer learning, let's dig in and take a look at how to do it for ourselves with TensorFlow and Keras.

In the next few videos you'll be using this notebook to explore transfer learning: https://colab.research.google.com/github/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%202%20-%20Part%206%20-%20Lesson%203%20-%20Notebook.ipynb
