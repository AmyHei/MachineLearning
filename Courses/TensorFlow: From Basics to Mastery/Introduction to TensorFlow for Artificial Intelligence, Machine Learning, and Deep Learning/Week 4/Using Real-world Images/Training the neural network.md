Now that you’ve learned how to download and process the horses and humans dataset, you’re ready to train. When you defined the model, you saw that you were using a new loss function called ‘[Binary Crossentropy](https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/)’, and a new [optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/RMSPropOptimizer) called [RMSProp](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf). If you want to learn more about the type of binary classification we are doing here, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqEc66RFY0I&t=6s) great video from Andrew!
