### Data, Beautiful Data

#### Worlds of Data

Mathematicians often speak of beautiful math. Yet, it seems those fruits often go unenjoyed. Let us, therefore, discuss the beauty of data in terms that a layperson may take some pleasure in.

‘Data’ as a word may sound cold and analytical. If I merely speak of myself as a data point, does that not detract from the humanistic element? Yet data is everywhere, and the things that we call beautiful are no exception. From the study of the stars to that of the microscopic world, the cosmos continuously churns out wondrous quantities of information.

#### Data in Nature

I’ll begin this discussion on the topic of nature, which is commonly accepted as a wellspring of beauty. Likewise, perhaps nowhere else is found more data than in the diversity of the natural world.

When we look at diversity on planet Earth, a natural point of discussion is the richness found in the tropics. Estimates point to the tropical regions as the source of [50-90% of all species on Earth](http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/files/amazon.pdf). The Amazon rainforest in particular, is home to roughly [1/3 of the world’s species](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/amazon-rainforest/). A 5 hectare block of Ecuador’s rainforest contains roughly [750 species](https://books.google.com/books?id=R-pKuIGEb5MC&pg=PA106&dq=5-hectare+patch). For comparison, a 5 hectare block of coniferous woodland (coniferous woodlands are found between 50 and 60 degrees north of the equator) typically contains 2 – 3 species of tree (1 hectare ~= 10,000 square meters or 2.5 acres). Setting the record in the late 80s, Alwyn Gentry found [approximately 300 tree species](https://www.pnas.org/content/85/1/156.short) in a hectare of everwet forests near Iquitos, Peru.
 
#### Urban Data

Presenting a stark contrast to the foliage of a forest, yet perhaps no less beautiful, the world of mankind is rich with information. Social media thrives on the value people find in photographs; likewise in music, literature, movies, games, and an assortment of other artifacts. [One estimate](https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-5) (from 2017) places the amount of data produced every day at 2.5 quintillion bytes.

Of the forms of data we look at, culture can be some of the most difficult to quantify. Yet, through modern techniques like t-SNE (developed in 2014 by Geoffrey Hinton) or the more recent UMAP, extremely high dimensionality data can be represented in a way meaningful for a human.

###### Be sure to check out [this awesome blog posting](https://medium.com/@LeonFedden/comparative-audio-analysis-with-wavenet-mfccs-umap-t-sne-and-pca-cb8237bfce2f) by Leon Fedden on dimensionality reduction techniques for audio.
With a technique called [‘t-SNE grid’](https://github.com/prabodhhere/tsne-grid), the usual amorphous clusters are replaced with a neat grid. This can make a collection of photos much more visually readable as whole.

###### Moritz Stefaner applied the t-SNE grid technique to 25K geo-located photos of Paris collected from social media. This piece was shown as a part of [123 data](http://123data.paris/) in 2017.
Visualizations like the one displayed above blur the line between the artistic and scientific. [Some criticise this approach](https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1245), but as our society becomes increasingly data-literate, it is inevitable that we explore these boundaries. And truly, is our culture made the worse by giving a stage to data-art? Nevertheless, we should maintain wisdom as data consumers to the difference between pretty pop-statistics and the more scientifically rigorous pursuit of truth.

#### Personal Data

Society is made up of individuals, and everyone of us is an independent factory when it comes to data. Each person who exists within the social media sphere adds to it every time they make even a tiny unconscious decision, such as how long to dwell looking at something or someone. Why do companies collect this data? The simple answer is, our personal information is collected to market products and services.

Becoming aware of the value of the value of data has lead to a movement and blog called [quantified self](http://quantifiedself.com/). The group holds [a yearly conference](http://qs18.quantifiedself.com/program/) to share methods and lessons learned. Health and exercise are some of the more commonly discussed topics.

#### Final words

There are numerous forms of recorded information, reflecting the myriad ways we the human race have found to containerize and communicate ideas. Over time this data becomes more and more plentiful at an astounding rate, due to the rise of social media and general improvements in device capabilities. Love it or leave it, data is here to stay.
