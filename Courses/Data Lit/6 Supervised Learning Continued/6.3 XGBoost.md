## XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
* [Optional] [A Gentle Introduction to the Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning)
* Introducing the Gradient Boosting and extensive references to understand XGBoost. (If you already understand Gradient Boosting, you may skip it.)
* [A Gentle Introduction to XGBoost for Applied Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-xgboost-applied-machine-learning/)
* Jason Brownlee, the same author, kindly introduces concept descriptions and additional learning materials for those who first learn XGBoost.
* [7 Step Mini-Course to Get Started with XGBoost in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-python-mini-course/)
* It is a 7 step summary with a simple Python code, and I think it will be helpful to clean up the concept.

## Kaggle

```
“Using XGBoost without parameter tuning is like driving a car without changing its gears; you can never up your speed”
```

* [What I’ve learned from competing in machine learning contests on Kaggle](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-i-learned-from-kaggle-contests-d3123e17a36b)
* In fact, this is about Kaggle, but good for people who want to participate in the Kaggle with XGBoost as a starter kit.
* [Optional] [An MVP Aproach](https://www.kaggle.com/karelrv/nyct-from-a-to-z-with-xgboost-tutorial)
* This is a tutorial detailed to solve the Kaggle problem with XGBoost with code. (from A to Z with XGBoost  Tutorial)

## [Optional] Further Reading
* [CatBoost vs. Light GBM vs. XGBoost](https://towardsdatascience.com/catboost-vs-light-gbm-vs-xgboost-5f93620723db)
* It introduces and compares three popular gradient boosting methods.
* [Complete Guide to Parameter Tuning in XGBoost (with codes in Python)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/)
* An comprehensive document to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost.
* [Accelerated Gradient Boosting(AGB)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02042.pdf)
* An interesting gradient boosting research paper, it improves performance by calculating Hessian in addition to the Gradient.
