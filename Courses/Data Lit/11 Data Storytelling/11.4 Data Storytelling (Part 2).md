### Introduction
Storytelling with good data and insight is intuitive and powerful.
Data storytelling can be thought of as an artistic investment into the effective communication of your analytic findings.
While we all know that data is key to telling an impact story, few understand how to use these points to spin meaningful tales that will resonate with their audience.
This time, we are looking into how to use data to peddle our message to those we want to reach.

##### Data + Storytelling + Design = Data Storytelling

### 1. Data
#### How To Acquire Data?
#### 1. Public data
##### [Forbes list](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/)
- [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/data.html): A large resource on US citizens which covers population data, geographic data, and education.
- [European Union Open Data Portal](http://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/): Another place to explore government data, but it is based on data gleaned from institutions in the EU of course.
- [Datacatalogs.org](http://opengovernmentdata.org/data/): Yet another open government data resource, except this one allows you to peer into data from the US, EU, Canada, and more.
- [NHS Health and Social Care Info Centre](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/home): You can find health data sets from the UK National Health Service in this database.
- [Amazon Web Services Public Datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets): This is a huge resource of public data, which includes the 1000 Genome Project, as well as NASA’s database of earth satellite imagery.
- [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance): This is a database made up of 40 years’ worth of stock market data, which Google updates in real time.

##### [Piktochart databases](https://piktochart.com/blog/100-data-sets/)
##### 2. Private data 
You need to gather internal data (whether it’s your own or belonging to a client) for reporting and transparency purposes.

- [Facebook Insights](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights) : A tool to track and analyze user interaction on their Facebook fan pages. useful when you gather data for your social media report on Facebook page performance.
- [Mailchimp Analytics](https://mailchimp.com/help/integrate-google-analytics-with-mailchimp/) – A tool for email campaigns, and to also learn more about their readers.
- [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none) – You can use it to analyze data from various touchpoints, whether it’s from the traffic that you’re getting to the site in terms of numbers and geography, to zeroing in to the way that people are interacting with it.

### 2. Storytelling

##### Five core narratives from [Buzzsumo](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-write-data-driven-stories-5-core-narratives/)

1. **Identify Trends:**
Trends are indicators that there is a general direction in which something is changing or developing, and it’s something you should look out for in your data.
Even a flattening trend can tell a story, like the graph on Twitter below.

2. **Using rankings:**
Rankings tell a story using data about the relationship between items on a list.
For example, is Vienna consistently being ranked number one in the list of most livable cities, while Vancouver is in second place? Are there certain areas in the United States that have higher crime rates than others?
3. **Draw comparisons:**
Comparisons tell a side-by-side story between either polar opposites, or very similar things.
For example, Using Twitter as an example again, this time we’ll compare the social network with the meteoric growth of Facebook.

4. **Look for surprising or counter-intuitive data:**
Data that challenges previously confirmed knowledge of what people know to be true, tells a great story.
For example, the sale of pop tarts apparently increased sevenfold before a hurricane. It seems that in anticipation for a natural disaster, people seek out comfort foods.

5. **Point out the relationship between data points:**
Relationships between data points tell a story by showing a connection or correlation between a number of variables.
For example, the influx of bitcoin mining companies moving to Canada is leading to rising costs in energy prices for local residents.

### 3. Design

#### Charts and Graphs
1. **Dot Matrix Chart:** to give a quick overview of the distribution and proportions in data categories, and to also draw comparisons across other datasets – if you are seeking patterns.

2. **Line graphs:** to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.

![](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Line-Graph-600x388.png)

3. **Bar graphs:** to show big changes in data over time, for example comparing electricity costs in cities across North America.

4. **Area graphs:** to track changes over time for one or more groups.

#### Design Elements To Know When Presenting Data
1. **DLayout:** Pay attention to proportions. Your readers should be able to take a ruler, measure the length or area of your graph, and find that it matches the relationship in your underlying data.
2. **DColors:** Consider your organization’s or client’s brand colors. Pieces of data that are considered supporting or less important, should be in muted or grey colors.
3. **DTypography:** The larger the text, the higher in importance. Your text should be horizontal only, and in 9 points (if in print) and 20 points (if on screen).

### Do’s And Don’ts
From [ebook that HubSpot published on data visualization design](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-863940581-pdf/Data_Visualization_101_How_to_Design_Charts_and_Graphs.pdf),

- Do use icons to improve comprehension and eliminate the need for too much labeling
- Do visualize your data in a way that makes it easy to compare values
- Don’t use more than six colors in a single layout as it can scatter attention
- Don’t use 3D charts as it can skew the perception of your data visualizations

### Hands-on : Let’s try data storytelling! 
We are going to use [Flourish, a platform for storytelling and visualisation](https://flourish.studio/) through data.

#### SETUP
1. Download the datasets from [github repo](https://github.com/lgellis/FlourishTutorial).
2. Sign up for the [Flourish beta](https://app.flourish.studio/).

#### CREATE A HORSERACE CHART

1. Select “Add Visualizations” and then select “Horserace Chart”.

![](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hr1-768x586.png)

2. Enter a chart name. In this example I call the chart “1-Violation Type Horserace”. Select “Data” and then “Import your data”.
3. Import in the spreadsheet “Violation_Type_Summary.csv” which you downloaded from the [github repo](https://github.com/lgellis/FlourishTutorial).
4. Select “Preview” to see the chart and “Export & publish” to either get the URL for the chart or to get the embed code.

#### CREATE AN ICON MAP CHART

1. Select “Add Visualizations” and then select “Icon Map”.

![](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/im1.png)

2. Enter a chart name.  In this example I call it “2-Traffic Violation Icon Map”.  Select “Data” and then select the tab “Data” and click the button “Import your data”.

![](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/im2-768x560.png)

3. Import in the spreadsheet “Violations_2017_1Day_Sample.csv” which you downloaded from the [github repo](https://github.com/lgellis/FlourishTutorial).
4. Click the “Icons” tab and import the spreadsheet “Vehicle_Type_Color_Icon.xls” which you downloaded from the [github repo](https://github.com/lgellis/FlourishTutorial).
5. Visit the chart settings.  In the “Map Starting Point” selection area, choose initial latitude=39.101751, longitude= -77.110758 and Zoom: 10.5.  In the “Default Icon Styles” selection area, choose size=10.

#### Demo

#### Conclusion

Storytelling with good data and insight is intuitive and powerful.

We learned how to get data, the requirements of good storytelling, and the design techniques that can effectively show these.

We also used the Flourish to see real data storytelling practices and demonstrations. As design techniques as well as data are important for effective message delivery, I recommend trying services that provide related services.
