### Data Science Presentation guide
Hello Wizards!

Today we are going to learn how to present data science research work.

‘Data Presentation’ is the method by which people organize, summarize and communicate the research and work using different tools such as charts, graphs, histograms, distribution charts, and diagrams. The common ways to present mathematical data are data analysis, drawing diagrams, tables, pie charts, and histograms.

There is no single way to present data research work. It depends on three different categories type of information, volume, and complexity of data and the audience that we are presenting our work to.

Type of Information :

What data you are working with carries major importance before you decide how you want to present it. If the data is mostly text related histogram carries very little value to your presentation. So being mindful about choosing the right visualization is very important. It’s very common for the technical people to feel that they are not being heard by the stakeholders. If the right way for a particular type of information is not chosen you will not able to communicate the data clearly for the business users and it’s most common and easy for them to tune out.

Volume:

We should always keep it simple when it comes to explaining things. Never scare the audience with big numbers mainly because it will take some time to process it and it may interfere with the flow of the presentation. Presenting mathematical data without numbers will be very hard and we can do little things to make the numbers friendly. Follow proper formatting. Use commas and abbreviation when possible. 100, 000 may be too much to process but 100k will be easy for them to do the math in mind. Always use the round figure and avoid the decimal. Right, align the numbers so the audience can see the relation more quickly.
 
Complexity :

Choose the form of visualization to explain the data. Try to avoid 3D graphs in the images, It will add confusion than clarification. In case if the 3D visualization is very important resort to video and do it in a proper way. Be very careful in choosing the charts so that you can convey the data representation clearly. Be more careful in mixing different chart types in the same image. If a chart is cramming multiple data series on them is purely to conserve the space of adding another chart it will as good as not being there. The fact that we understand our chart does not guarantee that the audience will do so too.
