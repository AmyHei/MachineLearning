## Assignment instructions
Let’s denoise images using autoencoder!

1. Use [Google Co-lab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or Jupyter)
2. Save your workbook to a Github repository
3. The first person to post their repo in the comments below will get a huge shout-out!

## Denoising Autoencoder
1. This is an example code written by Keras  for denosing autoencoder. https://www.kaggle.com/aakashnain/denoising-autoencoders-to-the-rescue/notebook
2. Improve the architecture for better result.
3. [Bonus]  rewrite code without using Keras. You can use anything else Keras (Torch or Tensorflow etc.)

## [Bonus] Advanced challenge

Using the denoising autoencoder, you can recognize wine labels like Vivino app or make a picture of a magic-gathering card into a neatly scanned image.

The blog post below is not a tutorial but a kind of research. The source code is not opened.

Take a look at the posting and try to implement it!
