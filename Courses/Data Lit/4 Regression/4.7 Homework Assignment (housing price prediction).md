### Homework Assignment (housing price prediction)

## Assignment instructions

1. Use Google [Co-lab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or Jupyter)
2. Save your workbook to a Github repository
3. The first person to [solve house prices prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and post their repo in the comments below will get a huge shout-out!
* You may simply use linear regression or use a more advanced regression method by referring to the tutorials below.
* It would be a good experience to submit prediction to the actual Kaggle, but it is optional.

#### Dataset
* [data_description.txt](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/data_description.txt)
* [train.csv](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/train.csv)
* [test.csv](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/test.csv)
* [sample_submission.csv](https://www.theschool.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sample_submission-1.csv)

## The Kaggle competition!

Both titanic and [house prices prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) are the most popular regression Kaggle challenges.
Let’s try to solve the [house prices challenge!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
Don’t worry, I prepared [great tutorial](https://medium.com/@pramos/kaggle-a-first-experience-on-machine-learning-and-regression-challenges-446436901b7e) for this. You can just follow it or modify to improve.

## Great tutorials with code

1. [Comprehensive Data Exploration with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python)
2. [Stacked Regressions : Top 4% on LeaderBoard](https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard)
3. [Tuned Random Forest, Lasso and XGBoost Regressors](https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaben/tuned-random-forest-lasso-and-xgboost-regressors)
* The first two links with walk you through the analysis in more detail, and help you to understand the dataset you’re given,
* While the last one will stand out as a resourceful approach to understand and compare different models.

Good luck wizards!!!
