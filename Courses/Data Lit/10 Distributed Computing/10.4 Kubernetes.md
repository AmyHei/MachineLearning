We are studying the most popular container orchestration open source, Kubernetes. I think it will be easier to understand if you have used a container like a docker.
After looking at the main components of Kubernetes’ overview and design, we would like to deploy the actual Voting app.

### Introduction
- Kubernetes is an open-source system, initially developed by Google, for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment.
- It aims to provide better ways of managing related, distributed components and services across varied infrastructure.
- Since it is open source, anyone can download and use it and realize its benefits.

### Brief History
- Google deploys more than 2 billion containers a week. All powered by an internal platform called Borg, the predecessor to Kubernetes.
- Originally an internal project within Google, Kubernetes was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2015.

### Example usage : Creating app running on WEB
Step 1. Create a cloud environment
Step 2. Containerize the app
Step 3. Deploy the containerized app to the cloud

### Overview
- Kubernetes, k8s, or kube, is an open source platform that automates container operations (orchestration).
- It eliminates most of the existing manual processes, which involve the deploying, scaling, and managing of containerized applications.
- It automates rollouts, rollbacks, and monitors the health of deployed services.
- It can scale services up or down based on utilization, ensuring you’re only running what you need.
- Like containers, Kubernetes allows us to manage clusters, enabling the setup to be version controlled and replicated.

### Kubernetes Architecture

#### Kubernetes objects
- [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) is the smallest deployable unit on a Node. It’s a group of containers which must run together.
- [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is used to define a logical set of Pods and related policies used to access them.
- [Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) is essentially a directory accessible to all containers running in a Pod.
- [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) are virtual clusters backed by the physical cluster.

#### Kubernetes Controllers

These Controllers are built upon the basic Kubernetes Objects and provide additional features.

- [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time.
- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is used to change the current state to the desired state.
- [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) is used to ensure control over the deployment ordering and access to volumes, etc.
- [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) is used to run a copy of a Pod on all the nodes of a cluster or on specified nodes.
- [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) is used to perform some task and exit after successfully completing their work or after a given period of time.

#### Kubernetes Control Plane
- The **Kubernetes Control Plane** works to make the cluster’s current state match your desired state.
- It records the object state and continuously runs a control loop to check if the current state of the object matches the desired state.
- You can think of it as the Government running the state.

### Kubernetes Master
- Kubernetes master works towards continuously maintaining the desired state throughout your cluster.
- The **kubectl** command is an interface to communicate with the cluster’s Kubernetes master through the Kubernetes API.
- Think of it as the police force responsible for maintaining law and order.

Each Kubernetes master in your cluster runs these three processes:

1. [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-apiserver/): the single point of management for the entire cluster. The API server implements a RESTful interface for communication with tools and libraries. The **kubectl** command directly interacts with the API server.
2. [kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/): regulates the state of the cluster by managing the different kinds of controllers.
3. [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-scheduler/): schedules the workloads across the available nodes in the cluster.

#### Kubernetes Nodes
- The Kubernetes nodes are basically worker machines (VMs, physical, bare metal servers, etc) in a cluster running your workloads.
- The nodes are controlled by Kubernetes master and are continuously monitored to maintain the desired state of the application.
- Previously they were known as **minions**. Similar to the master, each Kubernetes node in your cluster runs two processes:
1. [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/) is a communication interface between the node and the Kubernetes Master.
2. [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-proxy/) is a network proxy that reflects services as defined in the Kubernetes API on each node. It can also perform simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding.

#### Key concepts
- **Labels** : Labels for identifying pods
- **Kuberlet** : Container Agent
- **Proxy** : A load balancer for Pods
- **etcd** : A metadata service
- **cAdvisor** : Container Advisor provides resource usage/performance statistics
- **Replication Controller** : Manages replication of Pods
- **Scheduler** : Schedulers pods in worker nodes
- **API Server** : Kubernetes API Server
 

## Tutorial : The voting App

Let’s run an application on Kubernetes.

### Step 1 : Installing
- **Installing Kubernetes :** Download it [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (Community Edition)
- **Installing MiniKube :** To run Kubernetes locally you will need to install [MiniKube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).  (It’s for development and testing purposes only.)

### Step 2 : Run the Single Node Cluster
- Simply run the **minikube start** command.
```
$ minikube start
Starting local Kubernetes v1.10.0 cluster...
Starting VM...
Getting VM IP address...
Moving files into cluster...
Setting up certs...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Starting cluster components...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
Loading cached images from config file.
```

### Step 3 : Get the voting app
- git clone https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app
- The directory  “k8s-specifications” contains the Kubernetes yaml specifications of the Voting App’s services.
- It has two yaml files : a service file and a deployment file.
- **The Service file** defines a logical set of pods and the policies around them.
- **A Deployment file** is used to define the desired state of your application, such as the number of replicas that should be running at any given point of time.

Step 4 : Create the service and deployment objects 
```
$ kubectl create -f k8s-specifications/
deployment "db" created
service "db" created
deployment "redis" created
service "redis" created
deployment "result" created
service "result" created
deployment "vote" created
service "vote" created
deployment "worker" created
```
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-86b99d968f-s5pv7       1/1       Running   0          1m
redis-659469b86b-hrxqs    1/1       Running   0          1m
result-59f4f867b8-cthvc   1/1       Running   0          1m
vote-54f5f76b95-zgwrm     1/1       Running   0          1m
worker-56578c48f8-h7zvs   1/1       Running   0          1m
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db           ClusterIP   10.109.241.59            5432/TCP         2m
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1                443/TCP          23m
redis        ClusterIP   10.102.242.148           6379/TCP         2m
result       NodePort    10.106.7.255             5001:31001/TCP   2m
vote         NodePort    10.103.28.96             5000:31000/TCP   2m
```

### Conclusion
Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration engine. It can be used to amplify cloud containerization strategy as it is designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating containers.
