### Homework Assignment (Pyspark)

Hello Wizards.

So far we have been using pandas for most of our data pre-processing. Let us see why we cannot rely on pandas always.

Install spark in python – pip install pyspark will do.

Problem 1:

Read a CSV file ( any csv file of your choice) and write it to a file. Now do the same with pyspark and observe the difference. You will see multiple files as output. Briefly answer what is happening and how you can reduce multiple outputs into one single file.

Problem 2:

Download the Yelp review dataset and try reading the ‘user.json’ in pandas and spark. https://www.yelp.com/dataset

State the difference you experience.

Problem 3 :

In the above set of data, you can find a file named ‘photo.json’.

Count the unique values present in the labels field. Compare the time taken by pandas vs spark.

Comment your answers. Happy learning!!!
